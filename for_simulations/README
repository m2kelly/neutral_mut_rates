from introns:
subsitutions: need trinucs and alts for intron matrix + positions for s_obs
possible muts: need positions for l_s binning

from exons
subsiiutions: need positions for s_obs + positions for n_obs + total count for simulation
possible muts: need positions for l_s and l_n + positions, trinuc and alt for simulations 

currently have pipeline to output mu = s_obs/l_s - processes ref and target
but as will use again, probably better to process introns and exons seperatly and save tables?
but then a lot of merging large tables

pipeline
1) process introns: (-load intron data for anc and target seq, reverse comp and call subsiiutions
                     - save intron matrix plus list of positions at same time 
                     - drop anc seq 
                     - calculate possible muts ie pos of valid bases x 3)

2) porcess exons: -load anc and target seq, reverse comp fill exons etc
                  - add trinuc, remove flanks
                  - call subsitutions and save positions for syn and non syn in one file df?
                  - drop target seq
                  - call all possooble subs, save table with trinucs and alts and positions

3) using syn and non syn positions - bin genome base on l_s and l_n and save corresponding,
then load and merge per bin exon
